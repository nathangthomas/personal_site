    <p>This has been a long time coming. This being my leaving of AIM House. AIM House has been my place of employment for the last 6 years. For those of you who do not know about AIM House, it is a transitional home for young adults and I worked there a case manager and lead mentor. I helped many young men and women navigate mental illness and addiction as well as the difficult journey of indivduating from parents. My specialty is the incorporation of the outdoors and the spirit of adventure into my work. While I may be leaving the mental health world behind the spirit of adventure is always with me.
    <br><br>
    I made the decision to leave mental health work behind in 2016 the first time I left AIM. In the spring of 2017 Camille and I quit our jobs to follow winter to the Southern Hemisphere, New Zealand to be exact (More on that later). I never intended to return to AIM. I wanted to go back to school. I wanted to go back to school for mechanical engineering but upon returning stateside, nearly a year later I still could not stomach the idea of returning to school for another few years and going into debt to do it. I job searched for a few months and was given a few opportunities, but all payed less than I had made a year earlier at AIM and some were paying less than my minimum wage lifty job at the Remarkables in New Zealand. I felt trapped and without options so I reluctantly accepted a part-time job back at AIM to make a little cash while I weighed my options. Part-time quickly became full time and before I knew it I was back to my old role as a case manager at AIM (under different management and with significant programatic changes from a year ago). I missed helping others in this way and I was damn good at my job. Looking back I can say it was comfortable. I was hired back with a small raise in salary and off to work I went. Two years later I had not received a raise, bonus, or performance eval... and no amount of advocating was getting us any closer. Sometimes you need a nudge to make a life change. Working at AIM quickly went from comfortable to unbearable once I started to feel strung along. I began weighing my options more heavily and computer programming crossed my mind once again. Computer programming has always been a nagging interest, but something I told myself I could never learn. I was one of those kids who was told in grade school that I was just not good at math. It's the same reason I avoided math and ultimately all STEM related subjects in college despite the fact I have always been interested in science related fields. Chance and fate aligned one night when I met a young man who made the leap from sommelier to computer engineer just three year prior. For some reason in that conversation everything clicked and I realized what I had known for years. I did not have to continue to perpetuate the story I had on replay in my head. I did not have to continue down the same path of avoiding math because I "just wasn't good at it" and I didn't have to keep pushing away the reoccuring thoughts of becoming a computer programmer because I didn't grow up with a computer.
    <br><br>
    Everything I have learned to date came from an insaciable appetite to explore what was not known to me. I'm really good at fixing things because if something is broken and I don't know how to fix it I'll go crazy until I figure out how to fix it. I got comfortable, but there is one problem I have with comfortable. Growth does not happen in a state of comfort. So all this to say I quit my job and am beginning coding school at Turing on April 29th. Can I just say how great it felt yesterday to wake up on a Monday and know I didn't have to go into work. Ahhh, the smell of fresh coffee and freedom! I have almost 7 weeks until school starts. I plan to take full advantage of that time to get comfortable being uncomfortable.</p>
